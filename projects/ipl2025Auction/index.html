                <h3>Description</h3>
            </div>
            <p><span><b>Road Accident Analysis</b></span> is a data analysis project focused on identifying patterns and trends in road crashes. The project analyzes a comprehensive dataset with factors like weather conditions, lighting, accident types, injuries, and time-related variables, aiming to provide actionable insights into improving road safety and reducing accidents.</p>

            <p>Using Python and libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project involves <span>data cleaning</span>, <span>exploration</span>, and <span>visualization</span>. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, I used exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify significant factors contributing to accidents, such as the influence of weather and lighting on crash frequency and the impact of peak traffic hours on accident rates.</p>
            
            <p>Key findings from the analysis include the higher frequency of accidents during rainy weather, low visibility, and late evening/early morning hours. The project also explores the main causes of accidents, providing insights into the role of human, environmental, and infrastructural factors. This analysis highlights areas where targeted safety measures and interventions could be implemented, such as improving road infrastructure and driver awareness.</p>
            
            <p>The project provides valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and road safety authorities. It demonstrates the application of data science techniques to real-world problems, offering evidence-based recommendations that could lead to better road safety initiatives and ultimately reduce accident rates and fatalities.</p>

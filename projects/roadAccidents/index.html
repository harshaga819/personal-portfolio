            <p> <span><b>IPL 2025 Auction Analysis</b></span>This project focuses on the in-depth analysis of a comprehensive road accident dataset, which includes various factors that can contribute to road crashes. The dataset contains information such as crash date, weather conditions, lighting conditions, type of road defect, contributing causes, injuries (total, fatal, incapacitating), and time-related variables like the crash hour, day of the week, month, and year. Using Python, I performed extensive data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure that the data was accurate and usable for analysis.</p>
            <p>The project is built using Python, with libraries like BeautifulSoup for web scraping, Pandas for data cleaning and analysis, and Matplotlib for data visualization. Key data such as player statistics, auction prices, and past performance are scraped and cleaned to ensure accuracy. Interactive dashboards and visualizations are created to help users understand auction dynamics and trends more effectively. The application provides valuable insights on which players are likely to be high-value targets based on their performance, previous auction prices, and market demand.</p>
            <p>This project is ideal for IPL teams, analysts, and cricket enthusiasts who are interested in making data-driven decisions during the IPL auction process. It demonstrates the power of combining web scraping with data science techniques to extract meaningful insights from large datasets.</p>

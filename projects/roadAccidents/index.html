            <p> <span><b>Road Accident Data Analysis</b></span> This project focuses on the in-depth analysis of a comprehensive road accident dataset, which includes various factors that contribute to crashes. The dataset contains information such as crash date, weather conditions, lighting conditions, type of road defect, contributing causes, injuries (total, fatal, incapacitating), and time-related variables like crash hour, day of the week, month, and year. Using Python, I performed extensive data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure that the data was accurate and ready for analysis, allowing for a deep dive into accident trends and risk factors.</p>
            <p>The project is built using Python, with libraries like Pandas for data cleaning and analysis, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and NumPy for numerical computations. Key insights such as crash frequency trends, the impact of adverse weather, and injury severity distributions are extracted from the dataset. Interactive visualizations help in understanding accident patterns, peak crash hours, and major contributing factors. The analysis highlights how road conditions, weather, and driver behavior influence accident severity, providing a data-backed foundation for improving road safety measures.</p>
            <p>Beyond just statistics, this project tells a compelling story about how and why accidents happen, offering crucial insights that can be leveraged by traffic authorities, urban planners, and policymakers. By identifying high-risk areas and time periods, this study serves as a guiding light for future safety improvements such as better road infrastructure, optimized traffic regulations, and public awareness campaigns. It demonstrates how data science techniques can be applied to real-world problems, providing actionable insights to reduce accidents and enhance transportation safety for everyone on the road.</p>
